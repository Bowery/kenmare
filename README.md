Bowery Environment Manager.

## About

Kepler is responsible for creating and managing development environments, and keeping track of events that occur in them.
It is able to spin up instances on EC2, and will eventually be able to assist in reconstructing an environment
using the events it keeps track of.

Kepler uses Orchestrate.io as a datastore.
